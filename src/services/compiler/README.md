# Compiler Service

A powerful in-browser compilation service that leverages 🧑‍🔧 Web Workers to perform code compilation tasks without blocking the main thread. This service is built on top of `bundler-in-browser`.

Copied from <https://github.com/lyonbot/bundler-in-browser/tree/main/example/src/services/compiler> and modified to support Vue + rsbuild.
